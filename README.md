## How To (For Plugin Developers)

### - How to build this FriendSystem plugin?
   1. Clone this repository by typing this (```git clone https://github.com/LOSTEDs/FriendSystem.git```) in the command prompt or terminal!
   2. Open up your IDE (in this case, I use Intellij IDEA)!
   3. Open up this project!
   4. Use Maven to build this project! (There are two ways!)
      1. Use GUI to build the Project!
         - Once you opened the FriendSystem Project.
         - There should be a `pom.xml` file, please open it! Scroll down until you see `<outputDirectory>`, then change this to your desired OutputDirectory please!
         - After that, look at right-hand side! There should be a button named `Maven`.
         - Click that `Maven` button! Then, click `Lifecycle`. Last, click `package`!
         - Thus, you should be able to build the FriendSystem Project!
      2. Use commands to build the Project!
         - Open up a command prompt or terminal!
         - `cd` to the FriendSystem directory where the `pom.xml` file is located!
         - Then, use your favorite text editor to open up the `pom.xml` file. Scroll down until you see the `<outputDirectory>`. You can change this to your desired OutputDirectory!
         - Last but not least, execute `mvn package` to build/package the Project!
         - The FriendSystem plugin will be popped up in the directory where you've set it in the `pom.xml` file previously.

### - What are the build requirements?
   - [JDK 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/) or higher‚ùóÔ∏è(Pretty much this is the only requirement I suppose?)

   ‚ùóÔ∏èI strongly welcome everyone to submit a pull request at any point of time or submit an issue!‚ùóÔ∏è

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. How/Where do you store all the required data? 
   - When the server fires up, it shall create two folders which is `FriendSystem/data` inside of the `~/plugins` folder. 
   - Once a player joins the server, it will create a JSON file named by their UUID. Also, the path to the data is `~/plugins/FriendSystem/data`.
2. What versions of BungeeCord does this FriendSystem plugin support?
   - Sorry, I've only tested this FriendSystem plugin on **BungeeCord Version 1.18 - 1.19**. **I cannot vouch for other BungeeCord versions to work perfectly.**
3. There is a bug/there are bugs, what should I do?
   - Open an issue at the [Issues](https://github.com/LOSTEDs/FriendSystem/issues) section on this GitHub repository page or direct message me on Discord **LOSTED#8754**, please! Otherwise, I will find out your home address! :)
4. May I copy and paste the code from this repository, please?
   - You may!
5. Is this plugin available on [Spigot / BungeeCord Resources](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/bungee-proxy.3/) page?
    - No, not yet! Shhh! I'm just too lazy...

## Few In-game Screenshots

‚ùóÔ∏èSince I was on a Paper server without any "ranks" plugins, it would display the player's name a bit odd. However, as long as you have a "ranks" plugin, you will be fine... Trust me!
